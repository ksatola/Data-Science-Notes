    "# Python Cleaning Data\n",
    "A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. In fact, it is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This notebook gathers notes you can use to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose your data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers."

    "\n",
    "Your first task is to load this dataset into a DataFrame and then inspect it using the `.head()` and `.tail()` methods. However, you'll find out very quickly that the printed results don't allow you to see everything you need, since there are too many columns. Therefore, you need to look at the data in another way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.shape` and `.columns` attributes let you see the shape of the DataFrame and obtain a list of its columns. From here, you can see which columns are relevant to the questions you'd like to ask of the data. To this end, a new DataFrame, `df_subset`, consisting only of these relevant columns, has been pre-loaded. This is the DataFrame you'll work with in the rest of the chapter.\n",

    "You'll start by visualizing single variables using a histogram for numeric values. The column you will work on in this exercise is `'Existing Zoning Sqft'`.\n",

    "In the IPython Shell, begin by computing summary statistics for the `'Existing Zoning Sqft'` column using the `.describe()` method. You'll notice that there are extremely large differences between the `min` and `max` values, and the plot will need to be adjusted accordingly. In such cases, it's good to look at the plot on a **log scale**. The keyword arguments `logx=True` or `logy=True` can be passed in to `.plot()` depending on which axis you want to rescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that Python will render a plot such that the axis will hold all the information. That is, if you end up with large amounts of whitespace in your plot, it indicates counts or values too small to render."

As you saw here, you still needed to look at the summary statistics to help understand your data better. You expected a large amount of counts on the left side of the plot because the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles have a value of 0. The plot shows us that there are barely any counts near the max value, signifying an outlier."

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, your job is to make a scatter plot with `'initial_cost'` on the x-axis and the `'total_est_fee'` on the y-axis. You can do this by using the DataFrame `.plot()` method with `kind='scatter'`. You'll notice right away that there are 2 major outliers shown in the plots.\n",
